# - Find zlib
# Find the ZLIB includes and library
# This module defines
#  ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find zlib.h, etc.
#  ZLIB_LIBRARIES, the libraries needed to use zlib.
#  ZLIB_FOUND, If false, do not try to use zlib.
#
# This FindZLIB is about 43 times as fast the one provided with cmake (2.8.x),
# because it doesn't look up the version of zlib, resulting in a dramatic
# speed up for configure (from 4 minutes 22 seconds to 6 seconds).
#
# Note: Since this file is only used for standalone, the windows
# specific parts were left out.
