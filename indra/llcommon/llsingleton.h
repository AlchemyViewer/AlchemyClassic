/**
 * LLSingleton implements the getInstance() method part of the Singleton
 * pattern. It can't make the derived class constructors protected, though, so
 * you have to do that yourself.
 *
 * Derive your class from LLSingleton, passing your subclass name as
 * LLSingleton's template parameter, like so:
 *
 *   class Foo: public LLSingleton<Foo>
 *   {
 *       // use this macro at start of every LLSingleton subclass
 *       LLSINGLETON(Foo);
 *   public:
 *       // ...
 *   };
 *
 *   Foo& instance = Foo::instance();
 *
 * LLSingleton recognizes a couple special methods in your derived class.
 *
 * If you override LLSingleton<T>::initSingleton(), your method will be called
 * immediately after the instance is constructed. This is useful for breaking
 * circular dependencies: if you find that your LLSingleton subclass
 * constructor references other LLSingleton subclass instances in a chain
 * leading back to yours, move the instance reference from your constructor to
 * your initSingleton() method.
 *
 * If you override LLSingleton<T>::cleanupSingleton(), your method will be
 * called if someone calls LLSingletonBase::cleanupAll(). The significant part
 * of this promise is that cleanupAll() will call individual
 * cleanupSingleton() methods in reverse dependency order.
 *
 * That is, consider LLSingleton subclasses C, B and A. A depends on B, which
 * in turn depends on C. These dependencies are expressed as calls to
 * B::instance() or B::getInstance(), and C::instance() or C::getInstance().
 * It shouldn't matter whether these calls appear in A::A() or
 * A::initSingleton(), likewise B::B() or B::initSingleton().
 *
 * We promise that if you later call LLSingletonBase::cleanupAll():
 * 1. A::cleanupSingleton() will be called before
 * 2. B::cleanupSingleton(), which will be called before
 * 3. C::cleanupSingleton().
 * Put differently, if your LLSingleton subclass constructor or
 * initSingleton() method explicitly depends on some other LLSingleton
 * subclass, you may continue to rely on that other subclass in your
 * cleanupSingleton() method.
 *
 * We introduce a special cleanupSingleton() method because cleanupSingleton()
 * operations can involve nontrivial realtime, or might throw an exception. A
 * destructor should do neither!
 *
 * If your cleanupSingleton() method throws an exception, we log that
 * exception but proceed with the remaining cleanupSingleton() calls.
 *
 * Similarly, if at some point you call LLSingletonBase::deleteAll(), all
 * remaining LLSingleton instances will be destroyed in dependency order. (Or
 * call MySubclass::deleteSingleton() to specifically destroy the canonical
 * MySubclass instance.)
 *
 * As currently written, LLSingleton is not thread-safe.
