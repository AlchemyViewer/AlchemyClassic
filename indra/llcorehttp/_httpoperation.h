/// HttpOperation is the base class for all request/reply
/// pairs.
///
/// Operations are expected to be of two types:  immediate
/// and queued.  Immediate requests go to the singleton
/// request queue and when picked up by the worker thread
/// are executed immediately and there results placed on
/// the supplied reply queue.  Queued requests (namely for
/// HTTP operations), go to the request queue, are picked
/// up and moved to a ready queue where they're ordered by
/// priority and managed by the policy component, are
/// then activated issuing HTTP requests and moved to an
/// active list managed by the transport (libcurl) component
/// and eventually finalized when a response is available
/// and status and data return via reply queue.
///
/// To manage these transitions, derived classes implement
/// three methods:  stageFromRequest, stageFromReady and
/// stageFromActive.  Immediate requests will only override
/// stageFromRequest which will perform the operation and
/// return the result by invoking addAsReply() to put the
/// request on a reply queue.  Queued requests will involve
/// all three stage methods.
///
/// Threading:  not thread-safe.  Base and derived classes
/// provide no locking.  Instances move across threads
/// via queue-like interfaces that are thread compatible
/// and those interfaces establish the access rules.

	/// request queue to the reply queue directly via stageFromRequest
	/// and addAsReply with no existence on the ready or active queues.
