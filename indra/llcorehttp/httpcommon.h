/// @package LLCore::HTTP
///
/// This library implements a high-level, Indra-code-free client interface to
/// HTTP services based on actual patterns found in the viewer and simulator.
/// Interfaces are similar to those supplied by the legacy classes
/// LLCurlRequest and LLHTTPClient.  To that is added a policy scheme that
/// allows an application to specify connection behaviors:  limits on
/// connections, HTTP keepalive, HTTP pipelining, retry-on-error limits, etc.
///
/// Features of the library include:
/// - Single, private working thread where all transport and processing occurs.
/// - Support for multiple consumers running in multiple threads.
/// - Scatter/gather (a.k.a. buffer array) model for bulk data movement.
/// - Reference counting used for many object instance lifetimes.
/// - Minimal data sharing across threads for correctness and low latency.
/// 
/// The public interface is declared in a few key header files:
/// - "llcorehttp/bufferarray.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpcommon.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httphandler.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpheaders.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpoptions.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httprequest.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpresponse.h"
///
/// The library is still under early development and particular users
/// may need access to internal implementation details that are found
/// in the _*.h header files.  But this is a crutch to be avoided if at
/// all possible and probably indicates some interface work is neeeded.
///
/// Using the library is fairly easy.  Global setup needs a few
/// steps:
///
/// - libcurl initialization including thread-safely callbacks for SSL:
///   .  curl_global_init(...)
///   .  CRYPTO_set_locking_callback(...)
///   .  CRYPTO_set_id_callback(...)
/// - HttpRequest::createService() called to instantiate singletons
///   and support objects.
///
/// An HTTP consumer in an application, and an application may have many
/// consumers, does a few things:
///
/// - Instantiate and retain an object based on HttpRequest.  This
///   object becomes the portal into runtime services for the consumer.
/// - Derive or mixin the HttpHandler class if you want notification
///   when requests succeed or fail.  This object's onCompleted()
///   method is invoked and an instance can be shared across
///   requests.
///
/// Issuing a request is straightforward:
/// - Construct a suitable URL.
/// - Configure HTTP options for the request.  (optional)
/// - Build a list of additional headers.  (optional)
/// - Invoke one of the requestXXXX() methods (requestGetByteRange,
///   requestPost, etc.) on the HttpRequest instance supplying the
///   above along with a policy class, a priority and an optional
///   pointer to an HttpHandler instance.  Work is then queued to
///   the worker thread and occurs asynchronously.
/// - Periodically invoke the update() method on the HttpRequest
///   instance which performs completion notification to HttpHandler
///   objects.
/// - Do completion processing in your onCompletion() method.
///
/// Code fragments:
/// Rather than a poorly-maintained example in comments, look in the
/// example subdirectory which is a minimal yet functional tool to do
/// GET request performance testing.  With four calls:
///
///   	init_curl();
///     LLCore::HttpRequest::createService();
///     LLCore::HttpRequest::startThread();
///     LLCore::HttpRequest * hr = new LLCore::HttpRequest();
///
/// the program is basically ready to issue requests.
///

/// 3.  Construct a failed, HTTP 404 not-found status code:
///				HttpStatus(404);
///
/// 4.  Construct a failed libcurl couldn't connect status code:
///				HttpStatus(HttpStatus::EXT_CURL_EASY, CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT);
///
/// 5.  Construct an HTTP 301 status code to be treated as success:
///				HttpStatus(301, HE_SUCCESS);
