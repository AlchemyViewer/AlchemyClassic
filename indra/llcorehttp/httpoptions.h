/// Really a struct in spirit, it provides options that

/// Sharing instances across requests.  It's intended that
/// these be shared across requests:  caller can create one
/// of these, set it up as needed and then reference it
/// repeatedly in HTTP operations.  But see the Threading
/// note about references.
///
/// Threading:  While this class does nothing to ensure thread
/// safety, it *is* intended to be shared between the application
/// thread and the worker thread.  This means that once an instance
/// is delivered to the library in request operations, the
/// option data must not be written until all such requests
/// complete and relinquish their references.
///
/// Allocation:  Refcounted, heap only.  Caller of the constructor
/// is given a refcount.
