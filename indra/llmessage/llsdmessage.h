     * The response idiom used by LLSDMessage -- LLEventPump names on which to
     * post reply or error -- is designed for the case in which your
     * reply/error handlers are methods on the same class as the method
     * sending the message. Any state available to the sending method that
     * must be visible to the reply/error methods can conveniently be stored
     * on that class itself, if it's not already.
     *
     * The LLHTTPClient::Responder idiom requires a separate instance of a
     * separate class so that it can dispatch to the code of interest by
     * calling canonical virtual methods. Interesting state must be copied
     * into that new object. 
     *
     * With some trepidation, because existing response code is packaged in
     * LLHTTPClient::Responder subclasses, we provide this adapter class
     * <i>for transitional purposes only.</i> Instantiate a new heap
     * ResponderAdapter with your new LLHTTPClient::ResponderPtr. Pass
     * ResponderAdapter::getReplyName() and/or getErrorName() in your
     * LLSDMessage (or LLViewerRegion::getCapAPI()) request event. The
     * ResponderAdapter will call the appropriate Responder method, then
     * @c delete itself.
