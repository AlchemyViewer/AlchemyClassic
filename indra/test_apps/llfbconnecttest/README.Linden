1.  Description

    Exercises SLPlugin.  Specific functions and goals aren't clear
    from the source.

2.  Running

  2.1  Mac

    Make certain '.' is included in PATH.  E.g.:

       PATH=.:"$PATH" open build-darwin-i386/test_apps/llfbconnecttest/RelWithDebInfo/llfbconnecttest.app

    Otherwise the program won't find SLPlugin and will timeout and
    fail after 30 seconds and give you little information as to why.

    Running 'dtruss' on plugin test applications will give you a great
    deal of insight into why they aren't activating.
