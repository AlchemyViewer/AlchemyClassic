1.  Description

    Exercises SLPlugin.  Demonstrates mediakit plugin reuse and
    switchover as MIME type changes (web, quicktime, flash).


2.  Running

  2.1  Mac

    Make certain '.' is included in PATH.  E.g.:

       PATH=.:"$PATH" open build-darwin-i386/test_apps/llmediaplugintest/RelWithDebInfo/llmediaplugintest.app

    Otherwise the program won't find SLPlugin and will timeout and
    fail after 30 seconds and give you little information as to why.

    Running 'dtruss' on plugin test applications will give you a great
    deal of insight into why they aren't activating.
