@brief  Update the containing Second Life application bundle to the version in
        the specified disk image file.

        This Python implementation is derived from the previous mac-updater
        application, a funky mix of C++, classic C and Objective-C.

            # Viewer.app"). Most of the time, the version manager directs a
            # given viewer to update to another .dmg containing an app bundle
            # with THE SAME name. In that case, everything behaves as usual.

            # The case that was changed is when the version manager offers (or
            # mandates) an update to a .dmg containing a different app bundle
            # name. This can happen, for instance, to a user who's downloaded
            # a "project beta" viewer, and the project subsequently publishes
            # a Release Candidate viewer. Say the project beta's app bundle
            # name is something like "Second Life Beta Neato.app". Anyone
            # launching that viewer will be offered an update to the
            # corresponding Release Candidate viewer -- which will be built as
            # a release viewer, with app bundle name "Second Life Viewer.app".

            # On Windows, we run the NSIS installer, which will update/replace
            # the embedded install directory name, e.g. Second Life Viewer.
            # But the Mac installer used to locate the app bundle name in the
            # mounted .dmg file, then ignore that name, copying its contents
            # into the app bundle directory of the running viewer. That is,
            # we'd install the Release Candidate from the .dmg's "Second
            # Life.app" into "/Applications/Second Life Beta Neato.app". This
            # is undesired behavior.

            # Instead, having found the app bundle name on the mounted .dmg,
            # we try to install that app bundle name into the parent directory
            # of the running app bundle.
